It acts as a middleware layer that enables your native code to interact with external AI services. Here are the key components and ideas behind it:\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Kernel:** The heart of the Semantic Kernel. This is where you register all your connectors (which link your application to AI services) and plugins (which are modular units of native code that execute specific tasks). The kernel orchestrates all the interactions required by your AI workflow.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Agents:** Instead of relying on rigid sequential workflows, AI agents enable dynamic decision-making. Agents can interactively synthesize responses by invoking registered functions on-the-fly, enabling flexible and context-aware responses.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Connectors:** These are the bridges between your application and remote AI services—for example, the Azure OpenAI Chat service. They handle the communication, data formatting, and authentication required to make API calls.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Plugins (or Skills):** Modular functions that perform specific tasks. By grouping related native functions into plugins, the AI component can invoke these functions seamlessly during execution.\n",

                "The strength of Semantic Kernel lies in its ability to combine your existing code with state-of-the-art AI models. It’s designed to be flexible and future‑proof: whether you’re working with models from Microsoft, OpenAI, or even Hugging Face, you can swap them out without rewriting your entire codebase."
